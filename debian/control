Description: Python 3 API for using geospatial raster data with Numpy
 Rasterio reads and writes geospatial raster datasets.
 .
 Rasterio employs GDAL under the hood for file I/O and raster formatting.
 Its functions typically accept and return Numpy ndarrays. Rasterio is designed
 to make working with geospatial raster data more productive and more fun.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.

Description: Command line tool for investigating geospatial rasters
 Rasterio reads and writes geospatial raster datasets.
 .
 Rasterio employs GDAL under the hood for file I/O and raster formatting.
 Its functions typically accept and return Numpy ndarrays. Rasterio is designed
 to make working with geospatial raster data more productive and more fun.
 .
 This package contains a command-line line interface to rasterio "rasterio"
 which can be used to inspect raster datasets.
